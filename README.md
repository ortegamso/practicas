# Crypto Trading Bot & Marketplace

This project is a comprehensive platform for algorithmic cryptocurrency trading, featuring:

- **Multi-Exchange Trading Bot:** Focused on futures trading across Binance, Bybit, Bitmex, Huobi, and OKEx.
- **E-commerce Platform:** For selling bots, services, and promotional items, with a ticketing system for support.
- **Multi-Level Referral System:** Configurable up to 3 levels with adjustable percentage rewards.
- **Web3 & DeFi Integration:** For multi-network triangular arbitrage (Ethereum, Solana, etc.).
- **Algorithmic Trading Script Marketplace:** Users can publish, test (simulated/testnet), and run trading scripts.
- **Secure Sandbox Environment:** For executing scripts in various languages (Python, Node.js, PHP, C++, Java, Rust, Solidity).

## Architecture Overview

The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure, utilizing technologies such as:

- **Backend:** Node.js with Express and TypeScript
- **Frontend:** Next.js with React and Tailwind CSS
- **Databases:** TimescaleDB (for time-series data) and MongoDB (for flexible data)
- **Messaging:** Kafka for asynchronous communication
- **Caching:** Redis for low-latency data access
- **Orchestration:** Docker
- **Monitoring:** Grafana
